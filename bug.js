In React Native, a less common error arises when using AsyncStorage to store complex data structures like objects or arrays.  The AsyncStorage API only accepts strings. Attempting to directly store an object leads to a serialization error, resulting in data loss or unexpected behavior. For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
AsyncStorage.setItem('myObject', { key: 'value' });
```
This will fail silently, or produce unexpected results. The solution involves stringifying the object before storage and parsing it after retrieval.
